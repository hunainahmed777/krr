TEST: Memory Test
================================================================================

Query: What did we discuss about neural networks earlier?

ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
Research Findings:
1. CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): Specialized for image processing, excels at feature extraction through convolutional layers and pooling.
2. RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks): Designed for sequential data, maintains memory through hidden states, good for time series and NLP.
3. GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks): Generative model with adversarial training between generator and discriminator.
