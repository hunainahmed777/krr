TEST: Complex Query
================================================================================

Query: Research transformer architectures, analyze their computational efficiency, and summarize key trade-offs.

ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
Research Findings:
1. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): Bidirectional pre-training, excellent for understanding context.
2. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformers): Unidirectional decoder, excellent for text generation tasks.
3. Vision Transformers (ViT): Apply transformer architecture to image classification by treating images as sequences of patches.

Analysis:
Summary: Analysis of 3 options reveals distinct trade-offs. Each option excels in specific dimensions while having limitations in others. Choose based on priority and constraints.
