TEST: Simple Query
================================================================================

Query: What are the main types of neural networks?

ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
Research Findings:
1. CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): Specialized for image processing, excels at feature extraction through convolutional layers and pooling.
2. RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks): Designed for sequential data, maintains memory through hidden states, good for time series and NLP.
3. Transformers: State-of-the-art for NLP, uses self-attention mechanism, parallelizable, excellent for large-scale language models.
